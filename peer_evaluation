Peer's repository: Huiyong Lim



What is something you learned by reviewing your peer's project?
After looking at Huiyong Lim project I learned that you can move where the enemies are spawned.
 

What is something you saw in your peer's project that you would like to apply to your own programming projects?
I would like to change where some of my enemies spawn so that my game is a little more challenging.
 

What suggestions would you have for your peer to improve his/her code?
I would tell Huiyong Lim to think about making the spawn points for the enemies to be randomized to make his gmae more interesting.
 

What could have been clearer or better commented?
Huiyong Lim code was commented well but I was a little confused why he made the final score for his game 950 intead of the default score of 1000 
 

Was there anything in the code that was confusing to you? If so, what?
Huiyong Lim code was similar to my code he didnt have anything too differnet in his game compared to mine, so I wasnt confused when I looked at his code 
 

Does the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE?
yes the repository contain an appropriate LICENSE. 
 

What is something he/she could add to the README.md to make it more descriptive?
His README was good but he could explain what the coode for the bullet assignment does and what lines its on, so that anyone that doesnt take this class and doesnt know what we did in that assingment could read the README file and know what he's talking about. 
 

Pay a compliment to your peer based on the quality of his/her code.
Huiyong Lim I think you made a great game especially since this was are first acually 2D game in the class and I also liked that you took the time to change the position of the enemies becuase for someone who did the same assignment it was nice to be surprized when i opened up your game and saw something differnet from my own game makeing it more enjoyable to grade.
